Winery Queries:


- Add a new winery:
INSERT INTO Winery (WineryName, Licensed, ProductionSize, Vinyard, Winemaker, VarietalID, RegionID)
VALUES ($wineryName, $license, , $proSize, $winemaker, (SELECT VarietalID FROM Grape_Varietal WHERE VarietalName = user_varietal_text), (SELECT RegionlID
FROM Region WHERE RegionName = user_region_text));

- Update the winemaker:
UPDATE Winery
SET Winemaker = $winemaker
WHERE WineryName = $wineryName;

- Update the production size:
UPDATE Winery
SET ProductionSize = $proSize
WHERE WineryName = $wineryName;

- Filter the Wineries by grape varietal:
SELECT *
FROM Winery
WHERE VarietalID = (SELECT VarietalID FROM Grape_Varietal WHERE VarietalName = user_varietal_text);
